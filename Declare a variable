// To declare a variable, we first have to declare what variable it should be.

// First we create the string and giving it a name

string firstString;

// Then we give the string a value

string firstString = "This is my first string variable"";

// You can add step 1 and two together, so you dont get unnecessary code

string firstString = "This is my first string";

/* There is actually an easier way in Visual studio.

Visual studio can actually identify what variable it needs to be, if you use "var" - I know the definition might not be great, but see here: */

var firstString = "This is my first string"; Console.WriteLine (firstString);

// it will return: This is my first string
