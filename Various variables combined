// Browse through this code to see what is going on
using System;

// create the variables without value

short a;
int b;
double c;

// now lets give the variables values

a = 20
b = 30
c = a + b; 
Console.WriteLine("a = {0}, b = {1}, c = {2}", a, b, c

//the reason that we start with "0" is becasue 0 is the first number in the system

//the compiler will give the result
a = 20, b = 30, c = 50


//another way to write this code could be

short a = 20;
int b = 30;
double c = a + b
Console.WriteLine("a = {0}, b = {1}, c = {2}", a, b, c
